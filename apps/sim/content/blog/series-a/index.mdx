## Why we’re excited

Today we’re announcing our $7M Series A led by Standard Capital with participation from Perplexity Fund, SV Angel, YCombinator, and notable angels like Paul Graham, Paul Bucheit, Ali Rowghani, Kaz Nejatian, and many more. This investment helps us double‑down on our mission: make it simple for teams to build, ship, and scale agentic workflows in production.

## How we got here

We started earlier this year in our apartment in San Francisco. The goal was to rebuild our entire previous company (if you can call it that) from scratch on a visual framework. We figured that if we could at least build an AI sales and marketing operation solely using building blocks on a canvas, then anyone could build anything. Soon after, we'd built the foundation of what would become Sim. We were hellbent on being Open Source from day one, and we're proud that we've stuck to that commitment. 

## Progress so far

...so far...

## Our vision

We believe the next wave of software is agentic. Teams will compose specialized agents that reason, retrieve, and act—safely and reliably—across their business. Our focus is to provide the infrastructure and UX that make this practical at scale: from prototyping to production, from single‑agent flows to complex multi‑agent systems. On one end of the spectrum, there are SDKs and frameworks that are complex and require a lot of code to build and manage, and on the other end of the spectrum, there are platforms that are easy to use but severely limit in what you can build. Sim offers a platform that is both easy to use and powerful enough to build complex agentic workflows.

## What’s next

We’ll invest in building the community around Sim, and we'll be hiring across engineering, product, and design.  ...ADD MORE...

## We’re hiring

If you’re excited about agentic systems and want to help define the future of this space, we’d love to talk. We’re hiring across engineering, product, and design.
